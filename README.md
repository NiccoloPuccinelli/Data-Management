# Data-Management

This exam consisted of a written test and a project on the main topics of the course. 

Here is the work done together with my colleagues Marco Scatassi and Greta Gravina. In particular, we built a dataset concerning information relating to weather and traffic in the city of Milan, in the period between December 28, 2021 and January 10, 2022, using API. The language used is **Python** and **MongoDB** was chosen as DBMS.
